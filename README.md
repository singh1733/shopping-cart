# Shopping Cart Project
Description: This project demonstrates a mock shopping cart application built with React, using React concepts such as component structuring, state management, and routing with React Router. Users can navigate between a home page and a shop page, adjust item quantities, and dynamically manage their shopping cart.

Features:

Navigation: Seamless navigation between the home and shop pages using React Router.
Dynamic Cart: Users can add, remove, and adjust quantities of items in the cart, with real-time updates.
Product Fetching: Items are fetched from the FakeStore API, displaying images, prices, and product details.
Quantity Adjustment: Users can manually input item quantities or use increment/decrement buttons.
Interactive Cart Display: The cart slides in and out with a toggle, enhancing the user experience.
Styling: Custom styles enhance the user interface for a professional look and feel.
